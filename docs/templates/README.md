# Docx-templates [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guigrpa/docx-templates.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/guigrpa/docx-templates) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/guigrpa/docx-templates/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/guigrpa/docx-templates?branch=master) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/docx-templates.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docx-templates)

Template-based docx report creation.

## Why?

* **Write reports naturally using Word**, just adding some commands where needed for dynamic contents
* **Express your data needs (queries) in the template itself**, in whatever query language you want (e.g. in GraphQL). This is similar to *the Relay wayâ„¢*: in [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), data requirements are declared alongside the React components using that data
* A small **template language**: `FOR`/`END-FOR` (with support for table rows), `INS`, `SHORTHAND`, `QUERY`, `VAR`
* **Transparent JavaScript support** wherever it makes sense (`FOR`, `INS` and `VAR`), running in a separate Node VM for security
* **Nested** loops
* Custom **variables** and **shorthand** commands (useful for writing table templates)

Docx-templates relies on the .docx format, which is really complex, so **use with caution**, at least for now. Feel free to submit issues or (even better!) PRs.

If you need external plugins or other bells and whistles please also check out [docxtemplater](https://github.com/open-xml-templating/docxtemplater).

## Installation

```
$ npm install docx-templates
```

...or using yarn:

```
$ yarn add docx-templates
```

## Usage

### API

Here is a (contrived) example, with report data injected directly as an object:

```js
import createReport from 'docx-templates';

createReport({
  template: 'templates/myTemplate.docx',
  output: 'reports/myReport.docx',
  data: {
    name: 'John',
    surname: 'Appleseed',
  },
});
```

This will create a report based on the input data at the specified path. Some notes:

* All paths are relative to `process.cwd()`
* If the output location is omitted, a report will be generated in the same folder as the template

You can also **provide a sync or Promise-returning callback function (query resolver)** instead of an object `data`:

```js
createReport({
  template: 'templates/myTemplate.docx',
  output: 'reports/myReport.docx',
  data: (query) => graphqlServer.execute(query),
});
```

Your resolver callback will receive the query embedded in the template (in a `QUERY` command) as an argument.

Other options (with defaults):

```js
createReport({
  // ...
  cmdDelimiter: '+++',
});
```

### Writing templates

You can find several template examples in this repo:

* [SWAPI](https://github.com/guigrpa/docx-templates/tree/master/examples/swapi), a good example of what you can achieve embedding a template (GraphQL in this case) in your report, including a simple script for report generation. Uses the freak-ish online [Star Wars GraphQL API](https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql)
* [Several templates](https://github.com/guigrpa/docx-templates/tree/master/examples/sampleTemplates)
* [More specific templates, used for tests]( https://github.com/guigrpa/docx-templates/tree/master/src/__tests__/fixtures)

Here is the list of currently supported commands:

#### QUERY

You can use GraphQL, SQL, whatever you want: the query will be passed unchanged to your `data` query resolver.

```
+++QUERY
query getData($projectId: Int!) {
  project(id: $projectId) {
    name
    details { year }
    people(sortedBy: "name") { name }
  }
}
+++
```

For the following sections (except where noted), we assume the following dataset:

```js
const data = {
  project: {
    name: 'docx-templates',
    details: { year: '2016' },
    people: [
      { name: 'John', since: '2015' },
      { name: 'Robert', since: '2010' },
    ]
  },
};
```

#### VAR

Declare a custom variable (or an *alias*) for a given datapath:

```
+++VAR details project.details+++
```

#### INS

Insert the value at a given datapath (the second example uses a previously declared variable):

```
+++INS project.name+++ (+++INS project.details.year+++)
+++INS project.name+++ (+++INS $details.year+++)
```

#### FOR and END-FOR

Loop over a group of elements:

```
+++FOR person IN project.people+++
+++INS $person.name+++ (since +++INS $person.since+++)
+++END-FOR person+++
```

It also works for table rows:

```
----------------------------------------------------------
| Name                         | Since                   |
----------------------------------------------------------
| +++FOR person IN             |                         |
| project.people+++            |                         |
----------------------------------------------------------
| +++INS $person.name+++       | +++INS $person.since+++ |
----------------------------------------------------------
| +++END-FOR person+++         |                         |
----------------------------------------------------------
```

You can nest loops (this example assumes a different data set):

```
+++FOR company IN companies+++
+++INS $company.name+++
+++FOR person IN $company.people+++
* +++INS $person.firstName+++
+++FOR project IN $person.projects+++
    - +++INS $project.name+++
+++END-FOR project+++
+++END-FOR person+++

+++END-FOR company+++
```

#### SHORTHAND

Define an alias for a complete command (especially useful for formatting tables):

```
+++SHORTHAND name INS $person.name+++
+++SHORTHAND since INS $person.since+++

----------------------------------------------------------
| Name                         | Since                   |
----------------------------------------------------------
| +++FOR person IN             |                         |
| project.people+++            |                         |
----------------------------------------------------------
| +++[name]+++                 | +++[since]+++           |
----------------------------------------------------------
| +++END-FOR person+++         |                         |
----------------------------------------------------------
```


## [Changelog](https://github.com/guigrpa/docx-templates/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Similar projects

* [docxtemplater](https://github.com/open-xml-templating/docxtemplater) (believe it or not, I just discovered this very similarly-named project after brushing up my old CS code for `docx-templates` and publishing it for the first time!). Minor drawback: AFAIK, there is no way to embed the data query in the template.

* [docx](https://github.com/dolanmiu/docx) and similar ones - generate docx files from scratch, programmatically. Drawbacks of this approach: they typically do not support all Word features, and producing a complex document can be challenging.
