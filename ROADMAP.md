# Roadmap

* Run all JS in the same sandbox (so that the user can define his own JavaScript functions)
* Add special shorthand for inserts, e.g. +++<xxx+++
* Improve processing of commands: don't replace all whitespace by ' '
* ? Add FOR-COL (can be complex)
* Update docs

* Images
* FMPro adapter
