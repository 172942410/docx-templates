# Roadmap

- Improve preprocessing so that:
    - NOPE: CMD_NODE nodes are directly removed
    * Each command has its own w:t node
* Support loops at intra-text-node level
* Re-enable Flow
* FOR-COL
* Images
* Add loop skip callback (for isDelete and such)
* Add code execution capabilities: INS `code`
* FMPro adapter
